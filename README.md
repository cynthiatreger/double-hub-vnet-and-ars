# 2. Introduction

This lab demonstrates how a double Hub & Spoke topology leveraging Azure Route Server (ARS) can be used to provide On-prem, Transit and Inter-region connectivity as well as On-prem failover, i.e. a customer-managed version of a small vWAN deployment.

Why?

The Inter-region (Spoke-to-Spoke) and On-prem scenarios have been successfully deployed with both S2S VPN and ER On-prem connectivity. For simplicity and ease of reproduction, only the S2S VPN deployment is detailed here.
